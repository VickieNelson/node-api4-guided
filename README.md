# Web API Deployment Challenge

Guided project for **Web API IV** module.

In this project we will learn how to deploy a Web API to `heroku`.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) free account.

## Instructions

Please fork this repository and follow along **using your fork** as the instructor deploys the API to `heroku`.

## Setup continuous deployment from Github to Heroku

     - make port dynamic
     - for a node application they need to know how to run it. So, if we want npm start to work we need to add start script to PKG JSON with value of node index.js
